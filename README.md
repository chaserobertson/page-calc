# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and configured to calculate the number of pages per day one would need to read to finish a book by a certain date.

See the live app **[here](https://chaserobertson.github.io/page-calc)**.
